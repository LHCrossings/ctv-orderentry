# EDI Billing Redesign — "PDF drop → validation screen → upload-ready ZIP"

**Written:** 2026-07-07 (planning session with Lee; spec is written to be executed
by a different model/session — be prescriptive, verify cited line numbers before
editing, they will drift.)

**Goal:** One page. Lee drops all of a month's affidavit invoice PDFs; the system
extracts contract numbers, fetches the Etere post-log CSVs itself, reconciles
totals, picks the right EDI template deterministically, and presents ONE
validation screen (peek-and-fix) → one button → ZIP of TVB EDI `.txt` files
ready for upload.

**Non-goal:** changing the EDI record format itself. Generated `.txt` output for
identical inputs must remain byte-identical (see Golden Tests).

---

## 1. Current state (verified 2026-07-07)

Two separate utilities + manual glue between them:

### `/edi/post-log` — `src/web/routes/edi.py` (530 lines) + `templates/edi/post_log.html`
- `POST /edi/post-log/parse` — upload affidavit PDFs → `_extract_contract_number`
  (edi.py:19) pulls `Contract Number NNNN` + `Affidavit <invoice-id>` from PDF page 2.
- `POST /edi/post-log/generate` — `_fetch_all_reports_sync` (edi.py:331) logs into
  Etere web ONCE (limited license seats; always `etere_web_logout` in `finally`),
  downloads report `R100018_C18236_postlog_with_contract_no` as CSV per contract
  for a user-entered date range → returns a **ZIP the user must download/unzip**.
- `POST /edi/post-log/reconcile` — user RE-uploads PDFs + CSVs → compares totals
  (`_parse_pdf_affidavit` edi.py:37 vs `_parse_csv_totals` edi.py:108).
- `POST /edi/post-log/diff` — spot-level diff PDF vs CSV (`_diff_pdf_csv` edi.py:174,
  ±10 min airtime tolerance + rate match).

### `/edi/export` — `src/web/routes/edi_export.py` (512 lines) + `templates/edi/export.html`
- User manually places CSV+PDF pairs in `incoming/EDI/` (must be named
  `MMYY-NNN…`; CSVs additionally `*_<contract>_postlog.csv`).
- `GET /edi/export/scan` — pairs files by `MMYY-NNN` prefix, parses CSV
  (`_parse_export_csv` :34) + affidavit (`_parse_affidavit_pdf` :285), suggests a
  template (`_suggest_template` :326).
- Templates: 18 JSON files in `data/edi_templates/` (CRUD at `/edi/export/templates`).
- `POST /edi/export/generate` / `/generate-batch` — build the EDI records
  (`_generate_edi` :211; record builders `_r21`…`_r34`, trailing `12;1;<gross>;`).

### Why detection mis-fires (the Toyota-for-McDonald's bug)
`_suggest_template` (edi_export.py:326):
1. Pass 1 = **exact** string equality of affidavit advertiser vs template
   `advertiser_match`. Brittle; and `_parse_affidavit_pdf` swallows ALL errors
   (`except Exception: pass` :321-322) so a layout change → empty advertiser →
   pass 1 can never match.
2. Pass 2 = any ≥3-letter word of template `agency_name` present in the CSV
   **filename**. Davis Elen has 4 templates (3 McD + 1 Toyota) sharing those
   words → first alphabetical wins regardless of advertiser.
3. Pass 3 = `templates[0]` (alphabetically `bvk_ucdavis`). Never correct on purpose.

**Confirmed misdetections reported by Lee (2026-07-07) — all must become
regression tests for the new matcher:**
- McDonald's invoices → `davis_elen_socal_toyota` (4 Davis Elen templates share
  agency words; alphabetical winner).
- RPM **Thunder Valley** invoices → `rpm_muckleshoot` (3 RPM templates share
  "rpm"; `rpm_muckleshoot` sorts first). Thunder Valley also needs the market
  tie-break: two TVC templates exist (`rpm_tvc_cvc`, `rpm_tvc_sfo`).
- Unrelated invoices → `ocean_media_betmgm`: pass 2 matches ANY ≥3-letter word
  of the agency name in the filename, and "**media**" is generic — any filename
  containing "media" pulls the BetMGM template. Generic agency words must never
  match on their own.

### Known bugs in this code (from the 2026-07-07 audit — fix during this work)
- **Path traversal:** `csv_filename` from JSON body joined into `INCOMING / csv_fn`
  unsanitized in `/generate` (edi_export.py:459) and `/generate-batch` (:491).
  Reject when `Path(csv_fn).name != csv_fn`.
- **Silent failures:** `_parse_affidavit_pdf` (:321) and `_all_templates` (:244)
  swallow exceptions with no logging. Log and surface a per-row warning.
- Dead code: `_fetch_report_sync` (edi.py:319) has no callers; `_fetch_all_reports_sync`'s
  sys.path computation (edi.py:338) resolves to `src/` not repo root (works only
  because parser_bridge fixed sys.path earlier) — fix or remove while touching.

---

## 2. Key design decision: match templates by Etere customer ID, not strings

The affidavit already yields the **contract number** — the one identifier that
never varies. The contract header row holds the authoritative customer:

- `CONTRATTITESTATA.COMMITTENTE` → `ANAGRAF.ID_ANAGRAF` (customer). Verified
  pattern: `src/web/routes/airchecks.py:59`
  (`LEFT JOIN ANAGRAF a ON a.ID_ANAGRAF = ct.COMMITTENTE`).
- Agency: expect a `CONTRATTITESTATA.AGENZIA` column (customer-default agency is
  `ANAGRAF.AGENZIA`, see etere_direct_client.py:516-522). **Verify the header
  column exists** with a known contract before relying on it; if absent, customer
  ID alone is sufficient.
- ⚠ Verify once whether the affidavit's "Contract Number" equals
  `ID_CONTRATTITESTATA` or `COD_CONTRATTO`: take one real affidavit, run both
  `SELECT … WHERE ID_CONTRATTITESTATA = <n>` and `WHERE COD_CONTRATTO = '<n>'`.
  (The post-log report filter already accepts this same number, so it is almost
  certainly `ID_CONTRATTITESTATA`.)

**Template schema change** — add to each JSON in `data/edi_templates/`:
```json
"etere_customer_ids": [218, 431],   // one template can serve several ANAGRAF ids
"etere_agency_id": 203,             // optional, tie-breaker only
"market_match": "LAX"               // KEEP — tie-breaker when one customer has per-market templates
```
(Keep `advertiser_match` as a legacy fallback for brand-new customers whose
template hasn't been assigned an ID yet.)

**New matcher** (replaces `_suggest_template` as pass 0; keep old passes as
fallback, in order):
1. contract → `COMMITTENTE` (+agency) via one MSSQL query
   (`browser_automation.etere_direct_client.connect()` — see memory
   `feedback_db_query_pattern`).
2. Templates where `etere_customer_ids` contains that ID. If several, narrow by
   `market_match` against the invoice market (post-log CSV `nome2` column /
   affidavit `Market`). If still ambiguous → mark row "needs template pick",
   do NOT guess.
3. Only if no ID match: legacy advertiser/agency string passes — but flag the
   row `match_confidence: "fuzzy"` so the UI shows it amber, never silently.

**Backfill:** `scripts/backfill_edi_template_customers.py` — for each of the 18
templates, look up candidate `ID_ANAGRAF` by name (`ANAGRAF.NOME LIKE`) and by
recent contracts' `COMMITTENTE`; PRINT the proposed mapping and require a y/N
confirm before writing the JSONs (read-only against prod DB; audit rule: no
unconfirmed prod writes — this only writes local JSON but confirm anyway).

---

## 3. The EDI spec is KNOWN — validate against it, don't eyeball

The full TVB/MediaOcean Spot-Net electronic-invoice spec is transcribed in the
project memory **`reference_edi_spec.md`** ("TVB EDI Technical Spec") — record
types, field positions, max lengths, formats. Related memory
`project_edi_export.md` documents the template JSON conventions (representative
= CTV AE e.g. "Charmaine Lane"/"House"; salesperson = agency buyer;
`comment_top_by_market`). **Read both before implementing.**
(Note: `.claude/documents/tvb_xml_schemas/` is the *XML* proposal/order family —
a different, future interchange format. The invoice `.txt` this tool generates
is the positional semicolon format below. Don't conflate them.)

The validation screen must enforce, per field (hard error = blocks export;
warn = amber):

| Rule | Source |
|---|---|
| `advertiser_name`, `product_name`, `agency_name`, representative, salesperson ≤ 25 chars | R21 f2 / R31 f1-f4 |
| `agency_ad_code`, `agency_prod_code` ≤ 8 chars | R31 f24/f26 (strongly recommended non-empty) |
| Address lines ≤ 30 chars; agency EDI code ≤ 8; call letters = 4 | R21/R22/R23 |
| `invoice_date`, period/schedule/contract dates = 6-digit YYMMDD; `broadcast_month` = 4-digit YYMM | R31 f5, f9-f15 |
| `invoice_number` ≤ 10; `estimate_code` ≤ 10; rep/station order numbers ≤ 10 | R31 f7/f8/f21/f22 |
| Comments (R32/R33) ≤ 130 chars each | R32/R33 f1 |
| Money = integer cents, no separators, `-` prefix if negative; R34 gross/commission/net must satisfy gross − commission = net; R34 f12 = spot count | R34, dollar rules |
| R51: run date YYMMDD, time HHMM military, length seconds, copy_id ≤ 30, rate cents | R51 |
| Required records present: 21, 22, 23, 31, ≥1×51, 34, 12 | record table |

Known accepted omissions in current output (validated clean by TVInvoices
May 2026): R51 f3 DAY_OF_WEEK (Mon=1…Sun=7) left empty; R22 station
name/address empty. **Do not "fix" these silently — byte-identical golden rule.**
If ever needed, derive day-of-week from run_date behind an explicit option.

Upload to tvinvoices.com stays manual for now (the future step-4 automation in
`project_edi_export.md` is out of scope here).

## 4. Target flow (one page, `/edi/billing`)

```
[Drop zone: all affidavit PDFs for the month]
        ↓ POST /edi/billing/intake          (multipart)
  per PDF: extract invoice_id + contract_no (reuse _extract_contract_number),
  totals (reuse _parse_pdf_affidavit), header fields (reuse _parse_affidavit_pdf),
  save the PDF into incoming/EDI/, derive broadcast month from invoice prefix
        ↓ table of rows appears immediately (no Etere touched yet)
[Fetch post logs] button  ← deliberate button, NOT automatic: the fetch holds an
        ↓                    Etere license seat; one shared session for the batch
  POST /edi/billing/fetch  → _fetch_all_reports_sync into incoming/EDI/
  (async via asyncio.to_thread; per-row status streamed or polled)
        ↓ rows fill in: CSV totals, reconcile badge, template match
[VALIDATION SCREEN — the peek-and-fix]
  per row: 🟢 spots+gross match / 🔴 mismatch (click → spot-level diff modal,
  reuse _diff_pdf_csv) / 🟡 fuzzy template match or missing fields.
  ROUNDING RULE (Lee, 2026-07-09): fractional-cent rates are legitimate — the
  affidavit subtotal sums unrounded rates, the CSV sums rounded per-spot values
  (e.g. 2606-042 ct 2763: $6,588.24 vs $6,588.40, 56 × $117.647…). If spot
  counts match AND |gross diff| ≤ spot_count × $0.005, badge 🟡 "rounding",
  NOT 🔴 — exportable without force. TVInvoices flags it on upload and Lee
  confirms there; that is the expected workflow.
  Template dropdown (override), all EDI invoice fields editable
  (reuse export.html's editors). Export blocked until every row is green
  or explicitly checked "export anyway".
        ↓ POST /edi/billing/export (selected rows)
[ZIP of .txt files ready for upload]
```

Date range for the fetch: derive from the invoice-number `MMYY` prefix
(`_invoice_info` edi_export.py:258 already does this). **Default to the
broadcast month** (Mon of week containing the 1st → Sun of week containing the
month's last day — helpers exist in `src/backwrite/transformer.py`
`compute_broadcast_month` area), but show the range in an editable field before
fetch. ✅ CONFIRMED with Lee 2026-07-09: broadcast month is the right default.

## 5. Implementation plan (ordered; each phase shippable)

### Phase 0 — Golden tests + safety fixes ✅ DONE 2026-07-09
- [x] Golden fixtures captured from 3 real June-2026 pairs (2606-009 BVK UC Davis,
      2606-016 Davis Elen WA McD, 2606-058 TCAA — 239/72/549 spots) via the real
      scan→generate flow. `tests/fixtures/edi_golden/` holds frozen
      `*_input.json` (template+inv+spots) + byte-exact `.txt`;
      `tests/unit/test_edi_golden.py` locks them.
- [x] Path traversal fixed in `/generate` (400) + `/generate-batch` (skip+log).
- [x] Silent `except: pass` in `_parse_affidavit_pdf` + `_all_templates` (and the
      scan CSV catch) → logged warnings; scan rows now carry `warnings: []`.
- [x] Dead `_fetch_report_sync` deleted; `_fetch_all_reports_sync` sys.path root
      fixed to repo root (`parents[3]`).
- June 2026 full-batch reconcile run as validation: 15/15 contract numbers OK;
  14/15 totals exact. 2606-042 (Media Solutions, ct 2763): PDF subtotal
  $6,588.24 vs CSV $6,588.40 — fractional-cent rate (56 × $117.647… vs 56 ×
  rounded $117.65). Good future test case for the reconcile badge + R34 validator.

### Phase 1 — Consolidate the duplicated logic into a service module ✅ DONE 2026-07-09
Created `src/business_logic/services/edi_billing.py`; MOVED (not copied):
- [x] `parse_affidavit(pdf_bytes, source="") -> AffidavitData` — merged both
      affidavit parsers (header + totals + comment-box in one pdfplumber pass).
      Never raises; failures land in `.warnings`. `edi.py` wrappers re-raise on
      warnings to preserve the reconcile route's per-file error contract.
- [x] `parse_postlog_csv(csv_bytes, filename="") -> PostLogData` — merged spot
      parse + totals-row read; derived-vs-totals-row disagreement → warning.
- [x] `generate_edi` + `_r*` builders moved verbatim; golden test now imports
      from the service and passes byte-identical.
- [x] Template store (`slug`/`all_templates`/`get_template`), `invoice_info`,
      and legacy `suggest_template` (Phase 2 replaces it there).
- [x] Routes are thin wrappers; verified against the June batch: scan output
      and reconcile results identical pre/post move; 288 tests green.
- Deferred to Phase 3 as planned: `_diff_pdf_csv`, `_fetch_all_reports_sync`.

### Phase 2 — Template customer-ID matching ✅ DONE 2026-07-09
- [x] Verified live: affidavit "Contract Number" = `ID_CONTRATTITESTATA`;
      `CONTRATTITESTATA.AGENZIA` exists. Names via `ANAGRAF.RAG_SOCIAL`.
- [x] `match_template()` + `lookup_contract_customers()` (batch, one query,
      graceful DB-failure fallback to fuzzy) in the service. Legacy passes are
      the fuzzy fallback (flagged); generic agency words excluded; no
      default-to-first-template pass. `suggest_template` removed.
- [x] Market handling hardened: `resolve_market()` — CSV spot-level market
      (normalized, e.g. SAN FRANCISCO→SFO) outranks the affidavit header,
      which can be blank (2736 — regex grabbed "Fax" across newline, fixed)
      or wrong (2590 header says SEA, spots aired CVC).
- [x] Backfill run with Lee 2026-07-09: all 19 templates mapped. Notables:
      LA McD=368 (42 is Admerasia's McDonald's), SCVH=[398, 285] (renamed
      org, both), NYSDOH=44 only (22=NYC DOHMH is a different body), CDPR
      twins share 389 disambiguated by etere_agency_id (Hyphen 150 /
      iHeartMedia 388), Pulsar=364 (ANAGRAF name ≠ "OCHCA").
- [x] Scan returns match_confidence/candidates/detail + etere customer;
      export.html shows ✓/⚠/✗ badge, warn-bordered select, editor fields for
      the new keys, and save now merges over the existing template (was
      silently dropping keys the modal doesn't edit, e.g. comment_top_by_market).
- [x] Verified on the June batch: 15/15 customer-id matches (was 10/15
      correct-by-luck under string matching). 16 matcher/market unit tests
      incl. the three confirmed-misdetection regressions.

### Phase 3 — The unified `/edi/billing` page ✅ DONE 2026-07-09
Routes: `src/web/routes/edi_billing.py`; page: `templates/edi/billing.html`.
- [x] `POST /intake` — PDFs parsed + saved (sanitized, MMYY-NNN-prefixed);
      unparseable/no-invoice-id files rejected per-file; off-batch-month rows
      flagged amber (Lee's rule), never rejected.
- [x] `POST /fetch` — deliberate button; `fetch_postlog_reports` (moved into
      the service verbatim) — ONE Etere session, per-contract try/except,
      logout in `finally`. Default range = broadcast month
      (`broadcast_month_range`; bcast June 2026 = 6/1–6/28 ✓ matches R31),
      editable M/D/YYYY fields. Live-verified: single-contract fetch returns
      the identical June file. Retry = click again; only rows missing a CSV
      are fetched.
- [x] `GET /rows` — full assembly: affidavit + post-log totals,
      `reconcile_status` (match/rounding/mismatch/missing — rounding rule
      implemented: spots equal AND |Δgross| ≤ spots×$0.005), customer-ID
      template match, prefilled invoice fields, validation issues.
- [x] `POST /diff` — red-badge drill-down over `diff_pdf_csv` (moved to
      service), no re-upload.
- [x] `validate_invoice()` in the service — full spec §3 table; used by
      `POST /validate` (live, debounced from the UI) and the export gate.
- [x] `POST /export` — all-or-nothing: any red row (validation errors or
      reconcile mismatch, both recomputed server-side) → 409 with per-row
      reasons unless `force: true`; otherwise ZIP.
- [x] `billing.html` — drop zone, fetch bar, row cards with 🟢/🟡 rounding/🔴
      badges (red opens diff modal), match badges, field editors, live
      validation, per-row force checkbox, export gating. 🏠 home button.
- [x] Verified on the full June batch: 15/15 rows green (14 match +
      2606-042 rounding), all customer-id, 0 validation errors after fixing
      two genuinely over-spec template fields (H&L agency_name 26→"H&L
      Partners", TVC advertiser_name 28→"Thunder Valley Casino" — confirmed
      with Lee); export byte-identical to golden 2606-009; bad row 409s;
      force overrides. 320 tests green.

### Phase 4 — Cutover
- [x] Nav (2026-07-09): billing hub card "EDI Billing" → `/edi/billing`;
      old Post Log + Export cards demoted to "Legacy" badges.
- [ ] Run one real billing cycle (next month's invoices) on `/edi/billing`;
      old pages remain as fallback.
- [ ] After that clean cycle: delete `/edi/post-log` + `/edi/export` pages,
      routes, and hub cards (logic already lives in the service module).

## Verify (definition of done)
- [ ] Golden `.txt` outputs byte-identical through Phases 1–3.
- [ ] Real-month test with Lee: drop the month's PDFs; every McDonald's invoice
      matches a McD template and every Toyota invoice a Toyota template
      (the original bug); reconcile catches at least one known mismatch if one
      exists; export ZIP uploads clean to the EDI portal.
- [ ] Matcher regression tests for the three confirmed misdetections (sec. 1):
      Thunder Valley contract ID → `rpm_tvc_*` (never Muckleshoot) with CVC/SFO
      resolved by market; McD ID → McD template (never Toyota); a filename
      containing the word "media" with a non-Ocean contract ID must NOT match
      `ocean_media_betmgm`. In the legacy fuzzy fallback, drop generic words
      ("media", "group", "partners", "agency") from the agency word list.
- [ ] A PDF whose contract has NO template → row flagged, not mis-assigned.
- [ ] Fetch failure mid-batch (kill network) → session logged out, partial rows
      show errors, retry re-fetches only failed rows.
- [ ] 280-test suite still green; new unit tests for: matcher (ID hit, market
      tie-break, ambiguous → no-guess, fuzzy fallback flag), affidavit parser on
      2+ real PDFs, CSV parser totals cross-check.

## Open questions — RESOLVED with Lee (2026-07-09)
1. **Fetch range:** broadcast month (Mon of week containing the 1st → Sun of
   week containing the month's last day), shown in an editable field before fetch.
2. **Off-month PDFs:** flag with an amber warning, keep the row — never reject,
   never silently accept. Lee decides per row whether to fetch/export.
3. **Spot-level diff:** drill-down only (modal behind the red reconcile badge).
   The standalone `/edi/post-log` reconcile page goes away at Phase 4 cutover.
4. **Fetch trigger:** deliberate [Fetch post logs] button after intake review —
   never auto-fetch on drop (license seat + mis-parsed contract number risk).
